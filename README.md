SCLC (**S**team **C**ommunity **L**anguage **C**hanger) is a Userscript that changes the language of Steam on any steamcommunity.com page.

Have you ever tried to search for something Steam-related and clicked on a Steam community post on Google and the site was not in your language? Well, fear not dear user as this extension is going to help you!

>[!CAUTION]
>This script does not change the language of the actual post, it's only purpose is to change Steam's language.

## Installation
There are two ways to install SCLC:
* Install from the [latest release](https://github.com/smooll-d/sclc/releases/latest)
* Install form [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/pl/scripts/522391-steam-community-language-changer)

## Usage
After installation you have to do one thing:
* Nothing

Yes, nothing! Completely nothing, the extension will do all the work for you!

>[!TIP]
>If you enable the script while on a Steam community page, it will not refresh for you, you have to refresh manually, so the script can be enabled.
