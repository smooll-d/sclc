SCLC (**S**team **C**ommunity **L**anguage **C**hanger) is a Userscript that changes the language of Steam on any steamcommunity.com page.

Have you ever tried to search for something Steam-related and clicked on a Steam community post on Google and the site was not in your language? Well, fear not dear user as this extension is going to help you!

This extension will change any Steam community site to your preffered language.

>[!CAUTION]
>This script does not change the language of the actual post, it's only purpose is to change Steam's language.

## Installation
There are two ways to install SCLC:
* Install from the [latest release](https://github.com/smooll-d/sclc/releases/latest)
* Install form [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/pl/scripts/522391-steam-community-language-changer)

## Usage
Before v2.0.0, you had to manually change the language by editing the script, which had a couple problems with it, so now it's completely handled by the script, you don't have to move a muscle, SCLC will do all the work for you!

>[!CAUTION]
>If SCLC changes the language of Steam to English even though your browser is not in English, that means Steam does not support your language currently.

>[!TIP]
>The webpage will refresh to actually set the language, so wait patiently until it's refreshed!

>[!TIP]
>If you enable the script while on a Steam community page, it will not refresh for you, you have to refresh manually, so the script can be enabled, it will then set the language and refresh one more time.
