# SCLC
SCLC (**S**team **C**ommunity **L**anguage **C**hanger) is a userscript that changes the language of steamcommunity.com.

Have you ever tried to search for something Steam-related and clicked on a Steam community post on Google and the site was not in your language? Well, fear not dear user as this extension is going to help you!

When you have this extension installed it will change any Steam community site to your preffered language.

## Installation
It is very simple, click on the latest release, click on the userscript and install it. That's it.

## Usage
By default SCLC is set to change every page to English. If you want to change that, edit the script in your userscript manager of choice, find the line shown below:

```js
const language = "english";
```

Next, change the `"english"` to your language of choice, e.g. `"polish"`, `"french"`, `"german"`. **Don't forget to save!**

Now, next time you click on a Steam community post with a different language set, it will automatically set it to your language.

>[!NOTE]
>The webpage will refresh to actually set the language, so wait patiently until it's refreshed!

>[!NOTE]
>If you enable the script while on a Steam community page, it will not refresh for you, you have to refresh manually, so the script can be enabled, it will then set the language and refresh one more time.
